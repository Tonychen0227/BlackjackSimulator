<h1> BLACKJACK SIMULATOR</h1>

<h3> This is just a (FREE!) way to play BlackJack. </h3>

To run, simply <strong> python main.py </strong> in the project directory and follow prompts.

Currently supporting a manual player and an automated basic strategy player.

Future plan is to add betting schemes, such as martingale, labouchere, and positive incrementing methods.

Card counting is NOT viable as this is a CSM game (as most casinoes are, these days).
